# DocMark

DocMark is not designed to be an expansion of Markdown, but is strongly inspired by it. Where I find it is simpler or more elegant to depart from Markdown convention, DocMark will. It is intended to be used as format for writing notes and formatting collections of simple documents with a wider range of built-in data-presentation methods.
